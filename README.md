# RainFall Escape

RainFall Escape is a fun and engaging game where players navigate their character through a rainstorm, avoiding raindrops or using an umbrella for protection. The game has two modes: "Use Umbrella" and "Run!!!".

## Description

RainFall Escape is built using Python and Pygame. Players can choose between two game modes:

1. **Use Umbrella**: Protect yourself from raindrops by using an umbrella. Gain points for every raindrop you avoid.
2. **Run!!!**: Navigate through the rainstorm by running and avoid getting hit by the raindrops.

The game ends either when the player collides with a raindrop (in "Run!!!" mode) or when the time runs out (in "Use Umbrella" mode).
